# georgina #

georgina is an app that tracks the spending trends of your household. It answers questions like:

* what percentage of outgo is rent/mortgage?
* what are you spending on groceries?
* how much are you saving?

## Why?

I wanted to learn some Scalatra, and balancing a checkbook is a practical implementation.

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd Georgina
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
